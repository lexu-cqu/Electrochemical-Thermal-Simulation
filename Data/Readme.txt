This folder contains the constant current discharge data obtained using LIONSIMBA.
In this study, the freely available LIONSIMBA toolbox is used as the benchmark.
The LIONSIMBA toolbox can be found in https://github.com/lionsimbatoolbox/LIONSIMBA.

refVt_1C.CSV: Contains the battery terminal voltage under 1C constant current discharge.

refVt_2C.CSV: Contains the battery terminal voltage under 2C constant current discharge.

refVt_5C.CSV: Contains the battery terminal voltage under 5C constant current discharge.

refVt_10C.CSV: Contains the battery terminal voltage under 10C constant current discharge.
