Using the proposed electrochemical-thermal coupled battery model, we can obtain the internal variables of the battery, such as lithium concentration and potential. 
In this code, the battery is discharged using 1C constant current and two internal variables of the battery are plotted.
The first one is the electrolyte concentration at different time steps. This figure is also given in figure 2a in the submitted paper.
The second one is the solid phase surface concentration at different time steps. This figure is also given in figure 2c in the submitted paper.
