Using the proposed electrochemical-thermal coupled battery model, both the computational efficiency and model accuracy are improved significantly.
In this code, we provide the ASC-I model in Table 1 (Please see the submitted paper).
By running this code, you can see the simulation time and RMSE of voltage of the proposed model. These results are also given in Table 1 in the submitted paper.
