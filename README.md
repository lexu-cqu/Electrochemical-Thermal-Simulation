In this work, we propose an adaptive spectral method to reformulate an electrochemical-thermal coupled battery model. By discretizing the governing equation according to the lithium-ion concentration gradient and introducing a differentiation matrix, both the computational efficiency and model accuracy are improved significantly. The proposed reformulation method is also applicable to other problems involving partial differential equations, such as degradation and stress-strain models.
